# vivpeh-code
This repository stores numerical simulation algorithms for research related to vortex-induced vibration piezoelectric energy harvesters.
This programme needs to be run in MATLAB version 2016 and above.  

Instructions:
1. The file name with "fig" is the main programme that can be run directly.
2. The file with "MCS" is the Monte Carlo simulation.
3. The other files are subroutines that cannot be run independently.
